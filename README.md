#Introduction
This project is my steps in learning the basics of Clojure.

I've never worked with Lisp, Haskell or any other functional languages, and chose to try out Clojure because of it's hype. I also found it fascinating that Clojure can be compiled to run on JVM, .NET's virtual machine, and even be decompiled to JS.

#Getting Started
This project is a result of following R. Mark Volkmanns tutorial on Clojure. His tutorial can be found here http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html

#Project Euler
Over time I've found project Euler (http://project-euler.com) to be a good start point for learning the syntax and semantics of a new programming language. If you've solved the problems in a more familiar language it's fun to apply other languages to the same task as well. So far I've tried to solve these problems with Ruby, Python, and now with Clojure.

Project Euler is also a good place to learn how to do optimization of your code. However, I probably won't be doing too much optimizations in Clojure at this point.
  
###Problems solved
  * Problem 1
  * Problem 2
  * Problem 3 (slow)
  * Problem 12 (solution by Roboloco â€“ it's pretty neat)

##4 Clojure

Just discovered 4Clojure (http://www.4clojure.com/), which has a lot (134) of problems/assignments for Clojure. Probably going to from Project Euler tasks for a while, and too these more language-specific problems instead. 

###Problems solved
 * All Elementary 
 * Easy up to 30
  
  
#Noir
Noir (http://webnoir.org/) is a simple web framework for Clojure. Using Noir to learn some more practical Clojure when project Euler problems becomes theoretical.

I've started a small project to try Noir, it's called "noir-first". So far I'm finding the framework interesting. 

Gonna browse github for some ideas on how to program use Noir, and then create a simple Wall for people to post and comment stuff. 
  
###Progress
  * Got the simplest views working
  * Have some problems with the form validations.. Coming back to that later
  * Don't want to use time at this moment to figure out how to use a SQL DB with Clojure. NOIR BREAK!
  
  
  
  
#Concurrency 
  The real interesting part of Clojure and other functional languages, is being able to create concurrent programs "easily". I'm looking forward to this part, but I have no idea what to code yet. I got to get back too you on that one.
