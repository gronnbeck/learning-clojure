#Introduction
This project is my steps in learning the basics of Clojure.

I've never worked with Lisp, Haskell or any other functional languages, and chose to try out Clojure because of it's hype. I also found it fascinating that Clojure can be compiled to run on JVM, .NET's virtual machine, and even be decompiled to JS.

#Overall Progress
###Tuesday, 20. December
I'm finally starting to get "into" the language. I've spent many hours spread across about 12 days. It's a long way before I've mastered the language fully, and I'll continue working with tasks and read blog post too improve my understanding of Clojure. However, I don't think I'll fully own the language before I've had practical experience with it. I hope too to build a tool using Clojure someday, and another tool after that which has needs of it's concurrency capabilities. 

For now I'll work with 4clojure problems, I'm going to try to solve five to six problems a week.

#Getting Started
This project is a result of following R. Mark Volkmanns tutorial on Clojure. His tutorial can be found here http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html

#Project Euler
Over time I've found project Euler (http://project-euler.com) to be a good start point for learning the syntax and semantics of a new programming language. If you've solved the problems in a more familiar language it's fun to apply other languages to the same task as well. So far I've tried to solve these problems with Ruby, Python, and now with Clojure.

Project Euler is also a good place to learn how to do optimization of your code. However, I probably won't be doing too much optimizations in Clojure at this point.
  
###Problems solved
  * Problem 1
  * Problem 2
  * Problem 3 (slow)
  * Problem 12 (solution by Roboloco â€“ it's pretty neat)

##4 Clojure

Just discovered 4Clojure (http://www.4clojure.com/), which has a lot (134) of problems/assignments for Clojure. Probably going to from Project Euler tasks for a while, and too these more language-specific problems instead. 

I've posted some of my solutions in the 4clojure folder. It's exciting to work with hands-on problems, and it reminds me how hard it is too learn a new programming paradigm. 


###Progress
So far I'm at level 47, and things are getting harder and more interesting. Starting to dig into medium level problems, and my brain is starting too grasp functional programming again. 
  
  
#Noir
Noir (http://webnoir.org/) is a simple web framework for Clojure. Using Noir to learn some more practical Clojure when project Euler problems becomes theoretical.

I've started a small project to try Noir, it's called "noir-first". So far I'm finding the framework interesting. 

Gonna browse github for some ideas on how to program use Noir, and then create a simple Wall for people to post and comment stuff. 
  
###Progress
  * Got the simplest views working
  * Have some problems with the form validations.. Coming back to that later
  * Don't want to use time at this moment to figure out how to use a SQL DB with Clojure. NOIR BREAK!
  
  
  
  
#Concurrency 
  The real interesting part of Clojure and other functional languages, is being able to create concurrent programs "easily". I'm looking forward to this part, but I have no idea what to code yet. I got to get back too you on that one.
