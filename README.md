#Overview
  This project is my steps in learning the basics of Clojure.
  I've never worked with Lisp, Haskell or any other functional languages, and chose to try out Clojure because of it's hype. I also found it fascinating that Clojure can be compiled to run on JVM, .NET's virtual machine, and even be decompiled to JS. 

#Getting Started
  This project is a result of following R. Mark Volkmanns tutorial on Clojure.
  His tutorial can be found here http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html

#Project Euler
  Over time I've found project Euler (http://project-euler.com) to be a good start point for learning the syntax and semantics of a new programming language. If you've solved the problems in a more familiar language it's fun to apply other languages to the same task as well. So far I've tried to solve these problems with Ruby, Python, and now with Clojure.
  Project Euler is also a good place to learn how to do optimization of your code. However, I probably won't be doing too much optimizations in Clojure at this point.
  
##Problems solved
  * Problem 1
  * Problem 2
  * Problem 3 (slow)
  * Problem 12 (runs out of heap space..)
      â€“ Coming back later to optimization. Mean while, I'm going to try Noir
  
  
  
#Noir
  Noir (http://webnoir.org/) is a simple web framework for Clojure. Using Noir to learn some more practical Clojure when project Euler problems becomes theoretical.
  I've started a small project to try Noir, it's called "test-noir". I find the framework interesting, and I'm planning to build a simplistic Content Management System aka blog. 
  
  
  
#Concurrency 
  The real interesting part of Clojure and other functional languages, is being able to create concurrent programs "easily". I'm looking forward to this part, but I have no idea what to code yet. I got to get back too you on that one.
