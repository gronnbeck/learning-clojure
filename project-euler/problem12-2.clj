; 	Just realized something with my previous approach.
; I can do several of optimizations, they're:
;	* Remember which primes we've generated
;	* To binary search instead of linear search
;	* Another logic a cannot name, but will explain below
; It's hard to explain but I think we can do some major optimizations
; by changing the logic a little bit.
;	The previous version was calculation the factors of a triangle number
; from the base (recalculating possible primes), even though it was just
; a product of an previously calculated number. By knowing this we can
; easily compute factors for this number.
;	The math behind my optimization (not proved in anyway â€“ it's a long time since I used induction to prove anything):
; Let n be a triangle number, and let S be the set of it's factors. 
; If m is cn where c is a known constant, and D is the set of m's factors
; then m is the same as S union cD. 
;	Let's test if it works! 
; 	This also means that the number of divisors in D is the size of the set
; after S union cD. Is there a a way to compute this by just knowing the size
; of S instead of the acutal set S?
;	At the top of my head. I really don't know. So I'm going to program 
; it in a different way. However, if such calculation exists it'll probably
; speed up the algorithm a lot.

; - BENCHMARK 1 -----------------------
; (time (problem12 50))
; Number:  25200 has  90 divisors
; "Elapsed time: 696.353 msecs"
; -------------------------------------
;
; 	By just adding the "prime-remember" logic we have reduced
; the run time for (problem 50) with 2300 ms.
;	Before we can decide what to do next, we need to do another
; benchmark
;
; - BENCHMARK 2 ------------------------
; (time (the-divisors 500000))
; "Elapsed time: 155491.94 msecs"
; --------------------------------------
;
;	This bencmark tells us that the generation of divisors is way to slow
; when the numbers are getting large. Some of this run time is
; solved by previous generated primes. But probably to slow all in 
; all.
; 	So I'm going to try to optimize the-divisors. I'm starting to wonder if there
; might be a better solution to this problem.
;
; 	Taking a break from this problem.. I'm probably making it way more complicated
; than it has to be..
